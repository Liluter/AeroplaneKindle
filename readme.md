## Exercise with Aeroplane Image and Kindle Icon

### Idea
- After spotting the kindle icon on the desktop and the desktop background. I thought it was possible to combine the two images in an interactive way.
---
### Reasons:
- Main reason to do this project was to check Library Pixi.js   and how it works.
- Reson why try Pixi.js born after using .lottie files without using bodymovien plugin for Adobe After Effects. ( free trial only 7 days)
- Created lottie .json files supposed to be small but came out big.
---
###  Workflow
- Prepairing XRay layer texture in Gimp.
- Crate Scope texture in Inkskape.
- Use TexturePacker for preparation spritesheet file in .json very similar to .lottie files
- coding main code.
- add responsivnes.

### Conclusions
  - Pixi is easy in handle and it was just first steps with this library.
  - Next step would be create ready to implement scrolling animation from bunch of .jpg frames

- make some responsivnes with canvas.
